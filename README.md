# Ludum Dare 42
Top-down shooter where enemy corpses take up space. Corpses block bullets so you will need to upgrade your weapons and manage your surroundings to get a high score!

Movement: Use [W],[A],[S],[D] to move your character around the battlefield, shooting zombies toward your cursor with [Left Click].

Guns: There are three available guns: pistol, rifle, and submachinegun. Each has their own unique damage, reload speed, clip size, and penetration (how many zombies 1 bullet can go through). Toggle between these guns with [Q] and [E].

Items: There are three available items: bomb, decoy, and shield. Each has their own unique cooldown and behavior.

-Bomb: Use the bomb [1] to deal massive damage to all zombies within the blast zone. The bomb will destroy corpses! Note: We are aware of a bug where the bomb can only be used once.

-Shield: Use the shield [2] to block all zombie damage for a set amount of time.

-Decoy: Use the decoy [3] to distract the zombies and get them off you. The decoy is placed on the cursor, so place wisely!

After each wave, player will be teleported to a shop where they can upgrade their gunâ€™s clip size, accuracy, damage, and penetration!
